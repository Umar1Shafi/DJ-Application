## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in a simulated data stream using an **Adaptive Z-Score** method. The goal is to strike a balance between high anomaly detection accuracy and efficient execution time, ensuring the system works in real-time while handling dynamic data streams.

I have divided the solution into several steps: generating the data stream, detecting anomalies, visualizing results in real-time, and logging any missed anomalies for further review.

## Algorithm of Choice: Adaptive Z-Score

### Why I Chose This Algorithm

I chose the **Adaptive Z-Score** method because it offers a good balance between **accuracy** and **execution time**. The key principle behind the Z-Score is its ability to detect outliers based on standard deviations from the mean. By making the Z-Score **adaptive**, I am able to gradually update the mean and standard deviation as new data arrives, ensuring that the system responds to both slow and abrupt changes in the data stream.

This method allows for efficient detection of outliers without heavy computation, which is essential for real-time applications where execution speed is critical. Additionally, the **moving average window** used in this method ensures that the system adapts to recent data while still accounting for the overall trend.

### How It Works
- The Z-Score calculates how far a data point deviates from the mean in terms of standard deviations.
- As the data stream progresses, the algorithm adjusts the **mean** and **standard deviation** using an exponential moving average, which makes the calculations lightweight.
- A **dynamic threshold** is employed during the **warm-up period** to smoothly transition between initial and final thresholds, allowing the system to stabilize before more aggressive anomaly detection begins.

### Why It's Effective
The Adaptive Z-Score method is particularly effective for:
1. **Handling Drift**: As data trends evolve, the system adjusts its internal statistics, allowing it to capture both subtle and abrupt anomalies.
2. **Real-Time Efficiency**: The computational cost of updating the mean and standard deviation is low, making it suitable for processing thousands of data points without significant lag.
3. **Dynamic Thresholding**: The adaptive Z-score threshold helps ensure that early false positives are minimized, and anomalies are detected more precisely after the warm-up period.

## Limitations

One limitation of this approach is the **warm-up period**. During this time, the system is still adjusting its internal parameters, and as a result, it may miss some anomalies early in the data stream. The warm-up period helps prevent false positives, but it does come with the trade-off of possibly overlooking some early-stage anomalies.

## Methods to Solve Minor Issues

1. **Dynamic Z-Score Thresholding**: One challenge I encountered was determining the right threshold for Z-Scores to balance between detection sensitivity and false positives. By introducing a gradually decreasing threshold during the warm-up period, I was able to resolve this issue and improve detection accuracy as the data stream stabilizes.
   
2. **Handling Noise**: In real-world data streams, noise can sometimes be mistaken for anomalies. I added a **moving average window** to smooth out the noise, ensuring that minor fluctuations do not trigger false alarms.

3. **Missed Anomalies Logging**: To ensure no critical anomalies go unnoticed, I added a feature that logs any **missed anomalies** during the detection process. This helps in post-processing, allowing us to analyze and adjust the detection mechanism based on missed cases.

4. **Real-Time Plotting**: Real-time visualization helped immensely in debugging and fine-tuning the algorithm. By plotting both the detected and true anomalies, I could visually inspect how the system behaves and make appropriate adjustments.

## Conclusion

In summary, the **Adaptive Z-Score** method is a perfect fit for this anomaly detection task because it maintains a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. The real-time adaptability of the algorithm makes it particularly suitable for evolving data streams, while the moving average and dynamic threshold prevent unnecessary false positives. While the warm-up period may result in some missed early-stage anomalies, the algorithm performs well overall once the system stabilizes.
